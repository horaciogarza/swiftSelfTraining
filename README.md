# My Swift Self-Training :sunglasses:
This repo was made with the purpose of Swift Practice. :sunglasses: :iphone: :computer:

I highly recommend to look in my GitHub page if you wanna learn Swift
<a href="http://horaciogarza.github.io/swiftSelfTraining">GitHub page</a>

All the codes were tested at <a href="https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net">IBM Sandbox</a>, some of them were compiled at Linux but it was the same since IBM Sandbox works in Linux.
